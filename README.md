# WildLifeAlert

This app is in the developement stage. This passion project aims to ensure that any injured wildlife you encounter doesn't go unnoticed. With a simple alert, you can notify nearby rescue personnel who have the knowledge and experience to provide appropriate help. Every creature deserves a chance at survival, and every individual can make a difference. Using WildLifeAlert means you are never helpless when you encounter an animal in need.

Includes: A robust mechanism for persisting data and managing online/offline state with React Query, storing mutation results and resuming them when back online.
